But giving it a thought, it is also not good for students who are young and need to work on their academics. Using AI tools for work and projects puts a barrier on students’ thinking skills and makes them dependent on technology, which is not good for their academic journey.

Understanding the subject matter allows you to apply appropriate theories, gather
evidence, and form a coherent and well-structured discussion.</li>
              <li><strong>The format and word count:</strong> The ‘format’ of an assignment refers to the precise
layout and instructions for presenting the content, incorporating elements such as a
title page, table of contents, introduction, main body, and conclusion. It also guides
the application of headings, subheadings, font style and size, line spacing, and
margin dimensions. The term ‘word count’ refers to the anticipated length of the task,
usually outlined by the teacher. It aids in directing the level of analysis and
guarantees that the work remains succinct and targeted.</li>
              <li><strong>The deadline:</strong> The due date for an assignment is the designated time and day by
which the work needs to be handed in. It is important to ensure the assignment is
finished by the deadline to prevent any negative consequences like lowered grades
or having the submission rejected. Showing punctuality indicates strong time
management abilities and academic commitment. Planning, setting aside ample time
for research, writing, and revision, and submitting the assignment on time is crucial
for upholding high-quality work.</li>
              <li><strong>Specific questions or guidelines:</strong> During an assignment,
you might encounter particular questions to address or instructions to adhere to that
have been given by the instructor. These instructions delineate the main points or
issues that the assignment needs to cover, making sure that the content remains
centered and in accordance with the task&#39;s objectives. It is crucial to follow these
guidelines as they govern the assignment&#39;s structure, approach, and criteria for
evaluation. Following specific questions or instructions is essential for ensuring that
your response is clear, relevant, and comprehensive, covering all aspects of the
assignment thoroughly.</li>
              <li><strong>Citations:</strong> In assignments, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation" className="text-[#5b6cf2]  underline hover:no-underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
              Citations</a> are included to acknowledge the sources of
information or ideas that you did not originate. Various citation styles exist, each with
unique guidelines for formatting. The most frequent citation styles are APA (American
Psychological Association), favored in social sciences; MLA (Modern Language
Association), commonly utilized in humanities; Chicago/Turabian, known for its
adaptability and widespread application in history and other disciplines; and Harvard,
a popular choice in the UK and Australia. Different writing styles have rules for
referencing books, articles, and websites to avoid plagiarism and support your
argument with sources.</li>

            <ol>
              <li style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}><strong>1. Supporting Decision-Making:</strong> Decision-makers and investors rely on economic impact studies to determine whether a
project is worth pursuing. By assessing potential return on investment (ROI), these studies
help prioritize projects with the highest benefits.</li>
              <li style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}><strong>2. Justifying Funding:</strong> Governments with limited resources can use economic impact studies to justify public
spending. These studies highlight the potential advantages of projects, such as
improvements to infrastructure and public services.</li>
              <li style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}><strong>3. Mitigating Risks:</strong> These studies identify possible risks and adverse effects, allowing stakeholders to address
challenges proactively. For example, if a study reveals that jobs may be lost in certain
sectors, policies can be implemented to counterbalance the impact</li>
              <li style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}><strong>4. Ensuring Public Accountability:</strong> Economic impact studies inform taxpayers and voters, promoting transparency and ensuring
              that public resources are allocated effectively.</li>

            <ol>
              <li style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}><strong>1. Direct Impacts:</strong> These are the immediate economic contributions of a project or event, such as the jobs
created by a new construction or the spending generated by visitors. For instance, building a
new sports stadium directly creates jobs for construction workers, engineers, and other
professionals.</li>
              <li style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}><strong>2. Indirect Impacts:</strong> These impacts result from secondary economic activities triggered by the project. For
example, a new manufacturing plant might lead to local suppliers hiring more workers,
creating a ripple effect throughout the economy.</li>
              <li style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}><strong>3. Induced Impacts:</strong> These impacts reflect the economic benefits when project-related workers spend their
earnings within the local economy, boosting demand for housing, retail, dining, and other
services.</li>

            <ol>
              <li style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}><strong>1. Input-Output (I-O) Analysis:</strong> A widely-used method, I-O analysis examines relationships between economic sectors,
revealing how changes in one industry (e.g., manufacturing) affect others (e.g., supply
chains or retail).</li>
              <li style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}><strong>2. Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA):</strong> CBA is used to assess whether a project&#39;s benefits outweigh its costs. It helps
              decision-makers evaluate the long-term financial and social returns on investment</li>
              <li style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}><strong>3. Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Modeling:</strong> CGE models simulate how an economy reacts to external changes, showing complex
interactions between economic sectors and factors. They provide a comprehensive view of
long-term impacts.</li>
              <li style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}><strong>4. Economic Base Theory:</strong> This theory distinguishes between “basic” and “non-basic” sectors. Basic sectors (like
manufacturing and tourism) generate income for a region, while non-basic sectors (like retail
and healthcare) primarily support local demand. This method helps evaluate a project’s
contribution to the regional economic base.</li>

              <li style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}><strong>1. Olympics:</strong> Cities bidding to host the Olympics often conduct economic impact studies to assess the
short-term benefits of tourism and global attention. However, studies sometimes reveal that
large infrastructure investments do not always yield sustainable long-term gains</li>
              <li style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}><strong>2. Natural Disasters:</strong> Following natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina, economic impact studies are used to
assess damages and recovery costs. These studies evaluate impacts such as job losses,
infrastructure damage, and long-term economic effects on the local economy</li>
              <li style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}><strong>3. Public Infrastructure Projects:</strong> Major infrastructure projects like high-speed rail or airports often use economic impact
studies to assess job creation, regional connectivity, and environmental benefits. For
instance, California’s high-speed rail project utilized an economic impact study to analyze its
potential effects on job creation and sustainability.</li>
              <li style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}><strong>4. Policy Changes:</strong> Economic impact studies predict policy change&#39;s outcomes, such as increasing the minimum
wage or adjusting tax rates. These studies help evaluate potential effects on employment,
consumer spending, and business performance.</li>

              damage, displacement of local communities, or long-term maintenance costs</li>
              <li style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}><strong>3. Short-Term Focus:</strong> Many studies emphasize short-term impacts, leading to underestimating long-term economic
